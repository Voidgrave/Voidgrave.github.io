Yo little soul. I'm VoidGrave. The Grave of the Void. Excuse me if I'm being all over the place. I'm just having fun with what I'm doing!<br>
<br>
Who is VoidGrave? What meaning does this website have and does it need to exist? I don't know myself but ah well. This is just a fun little place for me to hang out in anyway. To have fun and show. Not much wrong with that is it? Of course not! I can do this how much that I want! The internet is somewhat my plaything, at least here on this site of mine. Anyway. Here is my other home.
